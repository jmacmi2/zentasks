The Play 2.1.x Java Guide sample application. Updated to work on 2.3.x where available.  

I've basically run through https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/JavaGuide1 using the edge version of play (not the RCs) and gotten things working. There are a few things that required updating (Tests, Less, etc.) I'll document the differences on this project wiki as and when I am confident the solution I've used is correct.
