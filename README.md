The Play 2.1.x Java Guide sample application. Updated to work on 2.3.x where available.  

I've worked through https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.0/JavaGuide1 to get an understanding of Play 2.  

Along the way I've found a few things that needed to change to get the demo application running in Play 2.3.x. Where possible I've added a decent guiding comment to the commit when I've had to stray from the guide.  

When I'm confident the solution I've used is correct I'll update the wiki on this project to describe the changes to speed up the task for my colleagues.
